# File Encoding Tool Requirements / convert

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a file encoding detection and conversion tool designed to work in both Windows and Linux environments. The tool will provide capabilities for analyzing file encodings and converting between different encoding formats, with a special focus on UTF-8 with BOM handling.

## Requirements Checklist

### Purpose and Scope
- [ ] Create a tool for managing and converting file encodings in Windows/Linux environments
- [ ] Support both analysis and conversion of encodings
- [ ] Focus on command-line usage and automation capabilities

### Analysis Mode Features
- [ ] Scan single files for encoding detection

- [ ] Recursively scan directories for encoding detection
- [ ] Detect presence/absence of BOM (Byte Order Mark)
- [ ] Display detailed file information including path and detected encoding
- [ ] Generate statistical summaries of found encodings
- [ ] Support filtering by file extensions
- [ ] Provide machine-readable output option (JSON/CSV)

### Conversion Mode Features
- [ ] Enable conversion between different encoding types
- [ ] Prioritize UTF-8 with BOM conversion capability
- [ ] Create automatic backups before conversion
- [ ] Provide preview functionality for planned changes
- [ ] Generate detailed conversion logs
- [ ] Support batch processing of multiple files
- [ ] Allow for conversion cancellation mid-process

### Supported Encodings
- [ ] UTF-8 with BOM (primary focus)
- [ ] UTF-8 without BOM
- [ ] UTF-16LE (Windows standard)
- [ ] UTF-16BE
- [ ] ASCII
- [ ] Windows-1252
- [ ] ISO-8859-1

### Safety and Security Features
- [ ] Automatic backup creation
- [ ] Post-conversion readability verification
- [ ] Comprehensive action logging
- [ ] Conversion rollback capability
- [ ] Verification of file integrity after conversion
- [ ] Protection against partial conversions

### User Interface Requirements
- [ ] Clear command-line parameters
- [ ] Scripting support for automation
- [ ] Configurable logging levels
- [ ] Progress indication for large operations
- [ ] Summary reports after completion
- [ ] Help documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Version information display

### Error Handling
- [ ] Robust handling of unreadable files
- [ ] Clear error messages for unrecognizable encodings
- [ ] Controlled abort functionality
- [ ] Operation resume capability after interruption
- [ ] Detailed error logging
- [ ] User-friendly error descriptions

### Special File Handling
- [ ] Handle read-only files appropriately
- [ ] Manage files that are currently in use
- [ ] Respect file permissions
- [ ] Process large files efficiently
- [ ] Support for network paths
- [ ] Handle special characters in filenames

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Minimal memory footprint
- [ ] Efficient processing of large file sets
- [ ] Support for parallel processing
- [ ] Cancelable long-running operations
- [ ] Progress reporting for extended operations

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Installation instructions
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Parameter documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Known limitations
- [ ] Best practices guide

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for file operations
- [ ] Performance tests for large files
- [ ] Error condition testing
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
The initial implementation should focus on:
1. Basic encoding detection for single files
2. UTF-8 with BOM conversion capability
3. Essential safety features (backups, logging)
4. Command-line interface with basic parameters

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
Following successful implementation of core features:
1. Directory recursive scanning
2. Additional encoding support
3. Advanced error handling
4. Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
Final phase should include:
1. Parallel processing capabilities
2. Network path support
3. Advanced reporting features
4. Comprehensive documentation

## Success Criteria
The tool will be considered successful when it can:
1. Accurately detect file encodings with 99.9% reliability
2. Convert files without data loss
3. Handle large directories efficiently
4. Provide clear, actionable feedback to users
5. Operate consistently across Windows and Linux platforms
